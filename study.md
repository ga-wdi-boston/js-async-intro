## The Event Loop

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works.

```md
Javascript engine executes the functions available in the call stack. If there
is any callback function, it is first loaded into the event table, and when it
is ready to be executed, it is moved to the event queue.
If teh callstack is empty, the callback functions in event queue will be
executed next. This process of listening to all these tables and queues are
handled by the event loop.
```

## Synchronicity and Asynchronicity

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async.

```md
Sync is a sequential flow of execution of functions.
Async functions are not a blocking code, which means it gets executed later.
```

## Async Advantages and Disadvantages

What are some advantages and disadvantages of async?

```md
Benefits:
Since the callback functions are not executed until thye call stack is free, it
is not a blocking code.
Disadvantage :
The order in which asynchronous functions are executed cannot be guaranteed.
```

## Event Loop?

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works?

```md
event loop is to store the callback function and excute it when the event is ready.
```

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async:

```md
sync means you can not excute another task before current task finishes.
async means you can excute another task before current task finishes.

```

What are some benefits and disadvantages of async?

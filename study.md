## Event Loop?

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works?

```md
The event loop evokes the callback in the non-blocking JavaScript code. When a non-blocking
I/O call finishes it emits an event. After the event is emitted, a callback function is performed.
```

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async:

```md
Asynch occurs in the background and synchronous lets your call finish.
```

What are some benefits and disadvantages of async?

```md
+You can navigate to other pages or interact with pages.
+Faster response time.

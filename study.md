## Event Loop?

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works?

```md
The event loop is the "to-do" list for keeping track of event order. It's kind of like an event manager.
The event loop invokes the call-back function too.
```
Used required readings and google searches.
In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async:

```md
Synchronous functions are basically single-file, where it's one at a time happening and can't be otherwise.
They happen continously over time.
Asynchronous functions can be put on hold and have other things happen before they're fully completed

Used required readings and google searches.
```

What are some benefits and disadvantages of async?

```md
Benefits: They provide better user experience when you have data-fetching or heavy processing within
an application.

Disadvantages: They're complicated to understand / implement.

Used required readings and google searches.

## Event Loop?

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works?

```md
The event loop is how javascript decides what to do next. Since it can only do one thing at a time, it sometimes puts off longer tasks until the quicker or more urgent ones are done. Or until it gets a response from another computer.
```

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async:

```md
Sync is when you do one thing at a time, strictly. So for example, if you request info from a server, you then just have to wait until the server responds before you can do anything else. Async is when you can put tasks on the back burner, so like when you request something from a server and while you're waiting for a response, you finish loading a file on your own machine.
```

What are some benefits and disadvantages of async?

```md
Async prevents long tasks from blocking the queue, so you can do other stuff while you wait for long tasks to complete. However, it means that those long tasks can build up themselves and you end up in callback hell, with way too many things you're waiting to do.
```

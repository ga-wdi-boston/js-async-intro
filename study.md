## Event Loop?

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works?

```md
The event loop also known as the main loop is the main place where events are
controlled. After the initial event, the event loop dictates when and what events
will follow
```

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async:

```md
Still did not understand it all the way through but my best guess from the readings
is that sync is strictly code being processed from one line to the other while
async lets codes go into multiple lines and still processed
```

What are some benefits and disadvantages of async?

```md
Not too sure on this one
```

# JavaScript Async Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

These studies focus on the differences between Asynchronous Code, and
Synchronous Code. For the most part, you can think of the differences as the
following. However, the readings will go into much more detail on the
differences and patterns of each.

Synchronous Code - operations the occur sequentially: ask db for data; wait; db gives data; do something with data.

Asynchronous - operations that may start in a certain sequence and may end in any permutation of that sequence while unrelated stuff happens in between.

## The Event Loop

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works.

`md
"The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions."" To me, this means that javascript executes a function, and it if is not being used, it is placed into a queu and waits/listens for an action to execute.

## Synchronicity and Asynchronicity

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async.

```md
Synchronicity: javascript executes a script, in order and waiting for execution to complete before moving on. A while loop is a good example.

Asynchronicity: code is uploaded, and queued. It gets executed once an event of a function execute to trigger an event.

## Async Advantages and Disadvantages

What are some advantages and disadvantages of async?

```md
advantage: Asynchronicity allows for dynamic web experience.
Disavantage: due to threading model. JS is single thread. Keeping units small helps to make your code more effeicient.

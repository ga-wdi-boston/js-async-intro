-   [What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

## Event Loop?

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works?
```md

<!-- The event loop is used in order to push callback functions into the task queue -->
<!-- when the stack is empty, as a result other code can be executed without  -->
<!-- holding up things.  -->

```

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async:

```md
<!-- Synchronous code has to be executed
in order,
Asynchronous code can be executed "out of order,". Tasks can run simultaneously.
Speeding up the rendering process.
 -->
```

What are some benefits and disadvantages of async?

```md
<!-- An advantage of using async are the time you save if rendering
large quantities of code. A disadvantage of asynchronous programming is that
it is easy to make mistakes on how things work and is it is easy to make errors.

```

## The Event Loop

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works.

```md
A loop that continues to run regardless of a possible error and it stores
information before being released into the code.
```

## Synchronicity and Asynchronicity

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async.

```md
If you execute code synchronously, you will wait for whatever it is to finish before
moving on to another task. If you execute code asynchronously, you can
move on to another task before it finishes.

## Async Advantages and Disadvantages

What are some advantages and disadvantages of async?

```md
I feel that being able to accomplish multiple task at once with async is
beneficial to the user, executing different code all at once. It could be a
disadvantage because things could go wrong when trying to execute multiple tasks
at once and not being privy to each task because of having more than one task.
```

# JavaScript Async Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and

process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
-   [Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMfg0xGjcOI)
-   [The Restaurant](https://www.codeschool.com/blog/2014/10/30/understanding-node-js/)
-   [Javes!](https://www.discovermeteor.com/blog/understanding-sync-async-javascript-node/) (until the section on fibers)

## The Event Loop

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works.

```md
The event loop is telling the selector when it wants to do something.
Example: when someone clicks on a link, it opens to another page.
This was from a recollection of today's teaching.
```

## Synchronicity and Asynchronicity

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async.

```md
When you sync, the process of the sending and receiving is blocked until the operation
is fully completed as for asyncing is when it plays the role of initiating the operation
whilst not blocking it. Execution of the operation through asyncing is immediate.
 /* not 100% sure about this */

## Async Advantages and Disadvantages

What are some advantages and disadvantages of async?

```md
With async, it's immediate and quicker in regards to processing the operation. /* pro */
With async, less functions for coding purposes; it is a cleaner format. /* pro */
/* not sure about the negatives */
```

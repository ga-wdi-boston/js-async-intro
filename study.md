## The Event Loop

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works.

```md
The event loop is a programming tool that uses events in a program. It makes a request to a provider that then calls an event handler, depending on the nature of the request.
```

## Synchronicity and Asynchronicity

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async.

```md
Asynchronous requests are better than synchronous requests because they are better performing. Synchronous requests tend to 'block' the execution of code because it runs one thing at a time. Asynchronous requests are better because it can run multiple lines of code.
```

## Async Advantages and Disadvantages

What are some advantages and disadvantages of async?

```md
advantage: faster, run code better and more efficiently
disadvantage: callback hell, it gets messy, deal with it
```

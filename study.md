# JavaScript Async Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

These studies focus on the differences between Asynchronous Code, and
Synchronous Code. For the most part, you can think of the differences as the
following. However, the readings will go into much more detail on the
differences and patterns of each.

Synchronous Code - operations the occur sequentially: ask db for data; wait; db gives data; do something with data.

Asynchronous - operations that may start in a certain sequence and may end in any permutation of that sequence while unrelated stuff happens in between.

## The Event Loop

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```
The event loop is a "line" of callback functions. The event loop is not triggered until the asynchronous ("not in order") code has run.
## Synchronicity and Asynchronicity

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async.

```md
Synchronous code consists of operations that happen in the order you would expect, or what humans would generally refer to as "in order". The outcome of synchronous operations is dependant on various funtions, so the returns may happen in various order. <!-- your answer here -->
```

## Async Advantages and Disadvantages

What are some advantages and disadvantages of async?

```I need more time to read up on the answer to this one. I stayed at GA until 7pm and completed the DOM study. I took a spin class at 7:30 and watched the YouTube videos on the train home and while eating dinner (my previous two anwers are based on the videos). I am drained at this point (10:45pm), but I will use my commute tomorrow and my time at GA before 9:00am to complete the readings.

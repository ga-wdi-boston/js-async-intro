## Event Loop?

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works?

```md
The event loop is a means of integrating events that have been passed to another handler back into the stack.
```

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async:

```md
Sync means that you can have multiple things working at once, asynch means that an event needs to wait for the previous event to end before it can start.
```

What are some benefits and disadvantages of async?

```md
The benefit of async is that you have a clear pattern of events that are happening, however you have a trade off that events can block other events from happening and slow down processes by doing this.
```

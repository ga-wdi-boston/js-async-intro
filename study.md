## The Event Loop

In your own words, describe the event loop and how it works.

```md
The event loop is something that monitors the stack and the queue. When there is something that it waiting to be run in the queue and the stack is empty, the event handler moves that something into the stack.

## Synchronicity and Asynchronicity

In your own words, describe the difference between sync and async.

```md
In general, javascript can only process one piece of code at a time. With sync javascript has to wait for the result of each process before it can move on to processing the next piece of code.

With async, javascript gets help from apis and the queue, so that it can process the next piece of code while the first piece of code is being processed, somewhere else, and then javascript will be notified when the result from the first piece of code is ready.

## Async Advantages and Disadvantages

What are some advantages and disadvantages of async?

```md
Async allows your code to be processed more quickly, but you can still have issue with your browser being stuck trying to render new pages if there are too many returns on the queque without adequate delays to let the page re-render.
